# Advent Of Code 2022
## My Solutions

Josh Jeppson

I am trying to do each day in a different language:

## Day 1: Python

Easy peasy. Python is a breezy.

## Day 2: Rust

Glad I got the experience

## Day 3: D

The D language is really cool, but does not appear to be mature. I had to do part 2 in Python since variable values for `string` variables seemed to be nondeterministically changing in D.

## Day 4: Kotlin

JVM languages, amirite?

## Day 5: ~~Lua~~ Python again

It took me several hours mucking around in Lua to decide to switch to Python and then it took me 10 minutes
